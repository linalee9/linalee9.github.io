title: Decibinary numbers
---

For a given $x\in\mathbb N$ such that

$$
x = \sum_{i = 0}^m a_i\cdot 10^i, \quad 0\le a_i\le 9,\,\forall i
$$

we define the decibinary value of $x$ as

$$
x_b = \sum_{i = 0}^m a_i\cdot 2^i
$$

There can be more than one number that has the same decibinary value:

$$
110_b = 30_b = 6_b = 6
$$

# Question

For a given value $n\in\mathbb N$, find the list of numbers in the ascending order that has the decibinary value $n$.

#### Example
If $n = 8$, the answer is $8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 104, 112, 120, 200, 1000$.
